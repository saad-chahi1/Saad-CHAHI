# Saad-CHAHI

Hello, I am Saad CHAHI a Software Engineer Student & web developer. I am involved in Front/Back End Web Development. Thereâ€™s nothing I enjoy more than playing with codes and designs (even though I am not a designer but I love to be), searching, learning new things, solving errors, helping others. I'm a positive person, naturally curious, and hard-working to improve my technical and soft skills. Got any questions? Contact me.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently self-employed working on web projects.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MongoDB.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a Web post.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'll be happy to help and share :D.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: saad.chahi1999@gmail.com or on my socials account Saad CHAHI.

âš¡ Beside Coding Life: Design using illustrator, Cooking, organizing events, managing Fb pages and groups, discovering new cultures and languages, reading books, handcrafting or drawing, and sometimes writing stories.
